Joomla-HTML-Bootstrap-overrides
===============================

A summary of HTML overrides for Joomla 3 and Bootstrap 3 and later.

This should be a community project. For the community from the community. I want to be the person to push this forward and provide the platform. Clone it, fork it, write issues, ideas. All contributions are welcome.

## General
The root folder of this repository is under <JoomlaRoot>/templates/<YourTemplate>/html/

For example: <JoomlaRoot>/templates/<YourTemplate>/html/mod_login

## mod_login
### modal box override
This override displays an button which opens a bootstrap modal box with the login form

## com_hikashop
Normal HikaShop supports bootstrap 2.3 but the latest bootstrap is 3.x.x with syntax changes. This overrides change the old syntax to support newer bootstrap versions.

### category/carousel
This override is a beginning to be bootstrap 3 based.

Done yet:
 * Horizontal slide with buttons
 * Horizontal slide without buttons
